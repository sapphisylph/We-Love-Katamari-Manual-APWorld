# We-Love-Katamari-Manual-APWorld
This is my manual APWorld for the game We Love Katamari Reroll. As of now, this does not have Royal Reverie support, but should work with the base game of We Love Katamari and the We Love Katamari Reroll remaster.

# Items
This manual has items for all of the following
- Cousins
- Presents
- Fans
- Unlocking levels (through YAML setting)
- And even some traps
# Locations
This manual has contains the following checks available:
- Completeing levels
- Rolling up cousins
- Rolling up presents
- Achieving the shooting stars
- And even *super clearing* each level
These should let you interact with the game in a way you probably have never done before.
# Settings
These are settings that should pop up when setting up your game
- Starting with a new or existing save file
- Unlocking individual levels or the fans themselves
- Cousinsanity and Presentsanity: Rolling with different cosmetics enables their own individual checks
- Disabling long and difficult checks: Some tasks the game gives you are either incredibly long or difficult and frustrating, so why not just turn those off to make the game more enjoyable for a quick run.
# Location Categories
If you're interested in customizing your game a little bit more and wish to set these up in the location checks, here are some of the categories that aren't expressely shown
- "Cousin Roll Ups"
- "Present Roll Ups"
- "Super Clears"

# How to install
Go to the releases on github (found on the right side of the screen on desktop) and download the latest APWorld version.
